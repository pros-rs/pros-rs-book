# Introduction

Welcome to the pros-rs book! In short, pro-rs lets you use the Rust Programming Language to program VEX V5 robots. Combining the power of Rust and the [PROS kernel](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/), it's ideal for programmers looking for a powerful yet simple development experience.

* Parallelize with a real [async runtime](https://docs.rs/pros/latest/pros/async_runtime/index.html)
* Develop, test, and [simulate](https://github.com/pros-rs/pros-simulator-gui) without access to a real robot
* Easily use thousands of compatible [crates.io](https://crates.io) packages
* Enjoy compile-time memory safety guarantees
* Gracefully handle and recover from [errors](https://docs.rs/pros/latest/pros/error/index.html)
